3. separate riskRoutes into smaller route files

----would be good to add but not essential-----

2. update colours of success messages. not clear that they are different, need to set time on how long message lasts
   -- dont like placement of message
2. user assign the risk to a sprint ie sprint 2
3. Change /updaterisk route - currently all fields to have a value but only 1 value might need edited?
4. dont require all fields to be re-entered when only one changes - user might only want to edit 1 field
5. Inline edit form on /home (modal or inline row)
6. more detailed errors to a separate file? for me to see not users

----Optional--------
