-- think i need to look at the status field, somethings not right but not entirely sure?
BACKEND TASKS
----Definitely Add-----
1. mitigation field - users suggest solution
2. user assign the risk to a sprint ie sprint 2
3. Kanban view of risks
----would be good to add but not essential-----
1. colour code risks in table - red for critical, green for open etc
2. update colours of success messages. not clear that they are different, need to set time on how long message lasts
   -- dont like placement of message

3. Change /updaterisk route - currently all fields to have a value but only 1 value might need edited?
4. dont require all fields to be re-entered when only one changes - user might only want to edit 1 field
5. Inline edit form on /home (modal or inline row)
6. more detailed errors to a separate file? for me to see not users

----Optional--------
1. Chart.js visualizations
   -- Risk-level distribution, status over time, etc.
3. logins
   -- only admins can delete or modify all risks?
4. GDPR or privacy notice in footer?

FRONT END TASKS
1. build a front end after back end core functions are working -- updated to do list at later date
   1. change LOW MEDIUM and CRITICAL to be coloured green orange and red
   2. update the view risk and edit risk routes to be better presented
